# Preamble {-}

We are writing the book because other books in this area are not very friendly, and assume too much knowledge on the part of the student.

This is a _sample_ book written in **Markdown**. You can use anything that Pandoc's Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

), 'packages.bib')
