# Why canâ€™t I just use a spreadsheet?: Promises and Challenges of the R Statistical Environment

**Learning goal**: Understand why statistical software is indispensable to data analysis and why R is a popular option. Provide an overview of the R Studio environment. Cultivate a tinkering mindset as concerns learning to use R.

From Dave: I think we should try to introduce R as a tool that makes our lives easier.  Analysts are often tasked with synthesizing vasts amounts of information.  This can be cumbersome and time-consuming.  We use R to delegate these cumbersome and time-consuming tasks to a computer. Ultimately R is something that we want learn because its saves us time and effort.  I think students have a tendency to frame R as burdensome skill rather than a helpful one.
